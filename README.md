# Marionette Boilerplate

A starting point for new Marionette v3 based projects.


### Getting started

1. Install nodejs (recommended @6.x)

2. install Gulp globally: `npm install --global gulp`

3. Clone repo, `cd` to cloned repo and `npm install`


### Running & building the project

* `gulp sandbox`: Runs development server, without live reload

* `gulp run`: The default task, builds runs the project in dev mode (**uncompressed** webpack chunks & **livereload**)

* `gulp runProd`: Builds project for production (**compressed** webpack chunks)
